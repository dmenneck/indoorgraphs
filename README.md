indoorgraphs is a nodejs package that enables (client-side) routing in your mapping application.

- <span style="color: rgb(112, 38, 185);">Attribute-based queries (accessible)</span>: Graph nodes and edges can be assigned attributes which can then be used to determine accessible routes.
- <span style="color: rgb(112, 38, 185);">Client-side:</span> What is unique about the routing functionality is that it can be performed client-side rather than server-side using a routing engine. This eliminates the cost and maintenance of running a routing server. The routing graphs can be stored as simple JSON files and retrieved from a web server at runtime.
